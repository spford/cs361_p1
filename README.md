# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Spencer Ford, Luis Acosta
* Class: CS361 Section #001

## Overview

This program implements DFA and FA interfaces making it possible to create deterministic finite automata.
After these machines are made the user can use this program to see if any string is in the language described
by the DFA.

## Reflection

We first started by implementing the DFA and FA interfaces in DFA.java. During this process we had to change the
type of storage objects we used to create the 5-tuple in memory because of the objectives and scope of this project.
Overall we feel as though this project came together in a straight forward manner and were able to accomplish the brief
in a timely manner. <br />

Personally, what worked well was developing a project board to lay out the development process and 
identify the individual challenges broken down to their smallest workable parts. Thankfully, with
the thorough lectures and in-depth homework assignment coupled with this project, the concept of
DFAs is very clear. The techniques I used to make the code easy to debug and modify was using 
numerous breakpoint to investigate values during runtime.

Overall, I am confident in our design and there isn't much I would go back to change. This confidence
stems from the fact we didn't need to develop our own data structures to implement our DFA but rather
utilized APIs from the Java library. <br />
