# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Spencer Ford, Luis Acosta
* Class: CS361 Section #001
* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

This program implements DFA and FA interfaces making it possible to create deterministic finite automata.
After these machines are made the user can use this program to see if any string is in the language described
by the DFA.

## Reflection

We first started by implementing the DFA and FA interfaces in DFA.java. During this process we had to change the
type of storage objects we used to create the 5-tuple in memory because of the objectives and scope of this project.
Overall we feel as though this project came together in a straight forward manner and were able to accomplish the brief
in a timely manner.


## Compiling and Using



## Sources used

We used Oracles website to find the best data structures to implement the appropriate interfaces.
